# Cold-Exposure-Firmware
The main objective of this code is create a firmware for a small device to use when working inside a cold chamber or any other extremely cold environment. In some work scenarios, where people have to work on extremely cold conditions, they can't exceed an amount of time exposed, so the idea is to create the code for a device the workers can carry around and use while they are inside a cold chamber for example.
## How will it work?
The code needs to cover the following features:
- The device needs to be able to turn on and off
- It also needs an alarm or special feature for when it has low battery.
- The worker has to be able to write in a personal pin, to let the device know who is entering the chamber.
- The device needs to send a signal/alarm to the worker using it when he/she is about to exceed the maximum time they can be exposed.
- Extra case, needs an option for the worker to leave at half the worktime.

That would be the main functions.
